Each Hearthstone match is a 1vs1 battle between two opponents. Gameplay in Hearthstone is turn-based, with players taking turns to play cards from their hand to cast powerful spells, equip mighty weapons, or summon vicious minions to do battle on their behalf. The game may be played between two human players, or one human and an AI computer opponent.

Each player is represented by their chosen 'hero', an important character from Warcraft lore. Each hero is associated with a particular class, which determines the special cards and unique hero power available to them. Each hero has 30 Health, and if their Health is reduced to zero, the hero is destroyed and the controlling player loses the game.

At the start of each turn, the player draws a new card from their deck - a collection of 30 cards selected before battle. Players can choose to play using one of several pre-assembled 'basic' decks, or one of their own custom-made decks. While most cards are available to heroes of any class (neutral cards), a substantial portion of them are limited to a specific class, giving each hero their own strengths and unique abilities.

During their turn, each player can choose to play any of their cards, use their Hero Power, command their minions to attack targets, or even have their hero attack directly if they have a weapon equipped. However, most actions require the player to spend mana, and this limitation forces players to strategically plan out their moves. Each player starts the game with 1 Mana Crystal, and gains one more at the start of each turn until they reach the maximum of 10 Mana Crystals. All of a player's mana regenerates at the beginning of their turn (all their Mana Crystals become 'filled'). Unspent mana remaining at the end of the turn does not carry over to the next. The larger mana pools in later rounds allow players to play increasingly expensive cards, opening the game up to more impressive moves and powerful abilities.

In theory the objective of a game of Hearthstone is simple: reduce the enemy hero's health to zero before they can do so to you. However, the game features multiple strategic elements which require mastery before one can be successful at competitive levels of play. The control of minions, the assignment of strategic importance to various targets, complex card synergies and interactions, as well as the unpredictability of the randomly selected cards drawn each round, combine to create a complex game where the best plays are not always obvious.

Completing a match will grant each player's hero experience, slowly increasing their level, and granting them access to extra cards. While concluding a match will reward both players with experience, winning matches offers additional rewards.
